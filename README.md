# sentiment-analysis
- This code gives pictorial analysis in all ways possible taken out of both text and non-textual elements from twitter data.
- Whole code is purely developed in python.
- We retrieve a bunch of tweets from twitter based on a buzzword / hashtag.
- Apply appropriate data cleaning techniques.
- Visualize miscellaneous sentiment as charts and wordcloud
- Put up twitter keys / tokens into files as necessary to get it running.
